# 🚀 **ReelRemix Deployment Guide - Get Live in 15 Minutes**

## **STEP 1: Frontend Deployment (Vercel) - 5 Minutes**

### **1.1 Get Your Frontend URL**
Since your frontend is already published on Vercel, you should have received a URL like:
- `https://reelremix-[random].vercel.app`
- Check your Vercel dashboard or the Manus UI for the exact URL

### **1.2 Test Your Frontend**
Visit your Vercel URL and verify:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ Auth page is accessible
- ✅ All pages render properly
- ⚠️ Backend API calls will fail (expected - we'll fix this next)

---

## **STEP 2: Backend Deployment (Railway) - 10 Minutes**

### **2.1 Prepare Backend for Deployment**
First, let's create the necessary files for Railway deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /home/ubuntu/reelremix/apps/worker

# Create package.json if it doesn't exist
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "reelremix-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "ReelRemix Automated Backend API",
  "main": "src/automated-server.cjs",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/automated-server.cjs",
    "dev": "node src/automated-server.cjs"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "axios": "^1.6.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
EOF

# Create Railway configuration
cat > railway.toml << 'EOF'
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[[services]]
name = "reelremix-api"
source = "."

[services.variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "3000"
EOF
```

### **2.2 Deploy to Railway**

**Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

**Option B: Using Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Connect your GitHub account
5. Select your ReelRemix repository
6. Choose `/apps/worker` as the root directory
7. Set start command: `npm start`
8. Deploy

### **2.3 Get Your Backend URL**
After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
- `https://reelremix-backend-production.up.railway.app`

---

## **STEP 3: Connect Frontend to Backend - 2 Minutes**

### **3.1 Update Frontend Environment Variables**

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your ReelRemix project
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add this variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app` (replace with your actual Railway URL)
4. Click "Save"

### **3.2 Redeploy Frontend**
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to "Deployments"
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2 minutes)

---

## **STEP 4: Final Testing - 3 Minutes**

### **4.1 Test Complete User Journey**
Visit your Vercel URL and test:

1. **Homepage**: ✅ Should load with all features
2. **Sign Up**: 
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Create a new account
   - Should redirect to dashboard
3. **Dashboard**: 
   - Should show user stats
   - Should display 100 free credits
4. **Video Upload**:
   - Click "Upload New Video"
   - Try uploading a small test file
   - Should show processing status
   - Should complete in 2-5 minutes

### **4.2 Verify Backend Health**
Visit: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health`
Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "ReelRemix Automated Server is healthy",
  "version": "2.0.0-automated"
}
```

## **STEP 5: Launch Preparation - Optional**

### **5.1 Custom Domain (Optional)**
If you have a domain:
1. In Vercel: Settings → Domains → Add your domain
2. Update DNS records as instructed
3. SSL will be automatically configured

### **5.2 Environment Variables for Production**
Add these to both Vercel and Railway:
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (when ready)
```
