# ReelRemix Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide covers deploying ReelRemix to production environments, from initial setup to ongoing maintenance.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning deployment, ensure you have the following accounts and tools configured:

**Required Accounts:**
- AWS account with administrative access
- Stripe account for payment processing
- OpenAI account with API access
- Domain name and DNS management access
- GitHub account for CI/CD integration

**Required Tools:**
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Docker and Docker Compose installed locally
- Node.js 18+ and npm for local development
- Git for version control

## Environment Setup

### 1. AWS Infrastructure Setup

**VPC Configuration:**
Create a Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones. The public subnets will host load balancers and NAT gateways, while private subnets will contain application servers and databases.

**Security Groups:**
Configure security groups to allow only necessary traffic. Web servers should accept HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet, application servers should only accept traffic from load balancers, and databases should only accept connections from application servers.

**RDS Database Setup:**
Create a PostgreSQL 14 instance in the private subnet with automated backups enabled. Configure the database with appropriate instance size based on expected load, typically starting with db.t3.medium for initial deployment.

**ElastiCache Redis Setup:**
Deploy a Redis cluster in the private subnet for caching and session storage. Use cache.t3.micro for development or cache.r6g.large for production workloads.

**S3 Bucket Configuration:**
Create S3 buckets for file storage with appropriate lifecycle policies. Configure CORS settings to allow uploads from your domain and set up CloudFront distribution for global content delivery.

### 2. Container Registry Setup

**ECR Repository Creation:**
Create Amazon ECR repositories for each service (api, worker, ai-service). Configure repository policies to allow ECS tasks to pull images and set up lifecycle policies to manage image retention.

**Image Building:**
Build and push Docker images to ECR repositories. Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size and security. Tag images with both latest and specific version numbers for deployment tracking.

### 3. ECS Cluster Configuration

**Cluster Setup:**
Create an ECS cluster using Fargate launch type for serverless container management. This eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances while providing automatic scaling and high availability.

**Task Definitions:**
Create task definitions for each service specifying CPU, memory, environment variables, and health check configurations. Configure logging to CloudWatch for centralized log management.

**Service Configuration:**
Deploy ECS services with appropriate scaling policies, load balancer integration, and health check configurations. Set up auto-scaling based on CPU utilization and request count metrics.

**Load Balancer Configuration:**
Configure Application Load Balancer to terminate SSL connections and forward traffic to ECS services. Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirects and configure security headers.

## Database Migration

### Initial Setup

**Schema Creation:**
Run Prisma migrations to create the initial database schema. This includes user tables, project tables, subscription tables, and analytics tables with appropriate indexes and constraints.

**Seed Data:**
Populate the database with initial configuration data including subscription plans, default settings, and administrative users. Use Prisma seed scripts for consistent data initialization.

### Migration Process

**Backup Strategy:**
Always create database backups before running migrations. Use RDS automated backups and create manual snapshots for critical migration points.

**Migration Execution:**
Run migrations during maintenance windows to minimize user impact. Use database transactions to ensure atomicity and implement rollback procedures for failed migrations.

**Verification:**
Verify migration success by running health checks and validating data integrity. Test critical application functions to ensure compatibility with schema changes.
